## Classes & Objects
- **Overview**: Discusses the importance of classes and objects in Python for organizing and enhancing programs.
- **Real-World Modeling**: Explains how classes and objects allow for modeling real-world entities that can't be represented by basic data types like strings or numbers.
- **Creating Custom Data Types**: Demonstrates how to create custom data types using classes, using the example of a `Student` class.

## Defining a Class
- **Creating a Class**: Shows how to define a class in Python, using `class ClassName:`.
- **Initialization Function**: Explains the use of the `__init__` function for initializing class attributes.
- **Attributes**: Discusses defining attributes like `name`, `major`, `GPA`, and `is_on_probation` within a class.

## Creating Objects
- **Instantiating Objects**: Covers creating instances of a class, known as objects.
- **Assigning Values to Objects**: Details how to assign values to object attributes during instantiation.

## Object Functions
- **Defining Functions in Classes**: Illustrates how to define functions within a class that can operate on object attributes.
- **Example Function**: Provides an example function `on_honor_roll` to determine if a student's GPA qualifies for the honor roll.

## Inheritance
- **Concept of Inheritance**: Introduces the concept of inheritance in Python, where a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- **Creating Inherited Classes**: Shows how to create a class that inherits from another, using the example of a `ChineseChef` class inheriting from a `Chef` class.
- **Overriding Methods**: Discusses how inherited classes can override methods from the parent class.

## Practical Examples
- **Chef Class Example**: Uses the example of a `Chef` class with methods like `make_chicken` and `make_special_dish`.
- **Chinese Chef Extension**: Explores extending the `Chef` class to a `ChineseChef` class, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding.
